## Information Architecture

Above details the high level flow map for how a user will complete their journey goals (ex make a deposit)

- With an weight to keep things simple the landing page with lean towards having two even call to actions (Deposit & Withdraw) for simplicity.
- Seeing the History will be through the navigation since this is action we assume new users won't be interested in till after doing 1/2 call to actions (subject to be changed).

![Main Layout](./images/d-LayoutEx.png)

Working through layouts that amplify simplicity and guidance we've favored a single column layout for the landing page that will show some sub navigation to switch easily between Deposit and Withdraw flow

For the curious there are also iterations for step by step guidance [tooltips](https://www.figma.com/design/n8jnoLE1WFTgvaBDI8wZqc/sBTC?node-id=33-110&t=WrRUjgMpDNw0Zk90-4) if the user would require

Working through our first landing page grayscale iterations.

- Current Fav: A center sub nav which would allow the user to easily switch between actions.
- Notice the sub title to the bottom left of the sub nav, "Deposit -> Convert BTC.." this tells the user how many further steps there are in order to complete this action.
